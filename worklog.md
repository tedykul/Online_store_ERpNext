Task ID: grocery-store-001
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Build grocery online store (sayuran & buah) with Next.js frontend + ERPNext integration

Work Log:
- Created types/grocery.ts — TypeScript interfaces matching ERPNext Item DocType
- Created lib/mock-data.ts — 23 mock products (Sayuran, Buah, Herbal, Paket) + 4 categories + formatIDR helper
- Created lib/erpnext.ts — ERPNext REST API client with 5s timeout, auto-fallback to mock when ERPNEXT_URL not set or unreachable. Implements: fetchProducts, fetchCategories, createSalesOrder, ensureCustomer
- Created lib/store/cart.ts — Zustand cart store with localStorage persistence, qty clamp to stock
- Created API routes: /api/products, /api/categories, /api/checkout (all force-dynamic)
- Updated globals.css theme to grocery green (oklch primary green) for light & dark mode
- Updated layout.tsx metadata (SayurBox), lang="id", SonnerToaster added
- Built components/grocery/header.tsx — sticky header with logo, search, cart button + badge
- Built components/grocery/hero.tsx — animated hero with floating emoji collage (Framer Motion)
- Built components/grocery/category-tabs.tsx — pill-style category filter
- Built components/grocery/product-card.tsx — card with emoji, badges (sale/organic), qty stepper
- Built components/grocery/product-grid.tsx — responsive grid (2-5 cols) + skeleton loader + source indicator (Live ERPNext vs Mock)
- Built components/grocery/cart-sheet.tsx — slide-in cart with free-shipping progress, qty edit, remove
- Built components/grocery/checkout-dialog.tsx — 3-step flow (form → loading → success) with delivery & payment method selection
- Built components/grocery/footer.tsx — 4-column footer with sticky behavior
- Built app/page.tsx — main page combining all components, client-side search + sort
- Created .env.local with ERPNEXT_URL=http://192.168.1.14:8001 (API key/secret empty → mock mode active)
- Verified with Agent Browser: page renders, 23 products load, add-to-cart opens sheet, checkout form validates & creates order, category filter works (8 buah products), search works ("tomat" → 1 result), no runtime errors, mobile responsive (390x844), footer sticky behavior correct

Stage Summary:
- Toko online grocery "SayurBox" lengkap & functional dengan 23 produk mock (siap connect ke ERPNext)
- Mode mock aktif otomatis karena ERPNext di 192.168.1.14:8001 tidak reachable dari sandbox
- API routes siap connect ke ERPNext — tinggal set ERPNEXT_API_KEY & ERPNEXT_API_SECRET di .env.local
- Checkout flow: form validation → POST /api/checkout → createSalesOrder → (mock) fake SO name / (erpnext) real Sales Order
- Semua interaktivitas ter-verify via Agent Browser (golden path: add cart → checkout → success)
- Lint clean, no runtime errors, responsive mobile & desktop

Task ID: sprint1-phase1-to-7
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Sprint 1 - Add nav, dark mode, About/FAQ/Contact sections, fix dead links

Work Log:
- Phase 0: Audited existing modules (Header, Footer, Hero, page.tsx, Prisma schema, db.ts). Confirmed git repo exists, ERPNext still in mock mode.
- Phase 1: Added dark mode toggle. Created theme-provider.tsx (next-themes wrapper, class strategy, system default). Created theme-toggle.tsx (hydration-safe with skeleton placeholder). Wrapped app layout in ThemeProvider. Added toggle button in header between search and cart. Committed.
- Phase 2: Added responsive nav menu. Created main-nav.tsx with MainNav (desktop inline, hidden mobile) + MobileNav (hamburger button + Sheet drawer). 5 anchor items: Beranda, Belanja, Tentang, FAQ, Kontak. Smooth scroll via scrollIntoView + scroll-mt-24 offset. Mobile menu has cart + theme quick actions. Added id='beranda' to hero, id='belanja' to product section. Committed.
- Phase 3: Created about-section.tsx. Brand story (misi menghubungkan petani-konsumen), visual emoji collage, 4 statistik (5000+ pelanggan, 120+ petani, 15 kota, 4.9 rating), 4 nilai (Segar, Harga Adil, Organik, Antar 2 Jam). Framer Motion whileInView animations. Semantic h2>h3>h4 headings. Committed.
- Phase 4: Created faq-section.tsx. 8 FAQ items (cara pesan, pengiriman, min order, pembayaran, kesegaran, organik, refund, jadwal). shadcn Accordion single-collapsible. CTA card linking to #kontak. Bug fix: MessageSquareQuestion not in lucide-react, replaced with MessageCircleQuestion (found via dev.log). Committed.
- Phase 5: Added ContactMessage model to Prisma schema (with @@index on status & createdAt). Pushed to SQLite via bun run db:push. Created /api/contact POST route with zod validation (name/email/phone/subject/message). Returns 201+ticketId on success, 422+errors on invalid. Created contact-section.tsx with 4 info cards + 5-field form (idle->loading->success states, char counter, aria-invalid, role=alert). Verified via curl + Agent Browser. Committed.
- Phase 6: Rewrote footer.tsx — all dead # links replaced with anchor navigation (#beranda, #belanja, #tentang, #faq, #kontak). Social media links now preventDefault + cursor-not-allowed + title='segera hadir'. Added back-to-top button (ArrowUp). Added id='promo' to promo banner + scroll-mt-24. Hero 'Lihat Promo' button now scrolls to #promo (was dead link). Hero accepts optional onViewPromo prop (backward compatible). Committed.
- Phase 7: Fixed accessibility warnings (Radix DialogContent missing Description). Added sr-only SheetDescription to CartSheet, sr-only DialogDescription to CheckoutDialog (always present, not just form step). Final verification: all 4 API routes return 200/201 via curl, all 5 nav anchors scroll correctly, mobile hamburger + dark mode work, full golden path (add cart -> checkout -> success) runs with ZERO console errors/warnings, sticky footer verified on short content. Committed.

Stage Summary:
- 8 commits total (1 per phase + audit). All commits atomic and backward compatible.
- Sprint 1 scope complete: nav menu, dark mode toggle, 3 new sections (About, FAQ, Contact), all dead links fixed.
- Backward compatibility maintained: Header props unchanged (searchQuery, onSearchChange), Hero onShopNow unchanged (onViewPromo added as optional), all existing API routes untouched, Prisma schema only added (not modified) ContactMessage model.
- Code quality: ESLint clean (one justified eslint-disable for next-themes official pattern), zero console errors, zero console warnings.
- New API route: POST /api/contact with zod validation + Prisma persistence.
- New Prisma model: ContactMessage (id, name, email, phone, subject, message, status, timestamps).
- New components: theme-provider, theme-toggle, main-nav, about-section, faq-section, contact-section.
- Accessibility improvements: aria-labels on nav/cart/buttons, aria-expanded on hamburger, aria-invalid on form fields, role=alert on errors, sr-only descriptions on dialogs, semantic nav/section/headings.
- Verified via Agent Browser (desktop 1440x900 + mobile 390x844): all interactions work end-to-end.

Task ID: sprint2-phase1-to-5
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Sprint 2 - Product detail modal, advanced filter, testimonials, trust badges

Work Log:
- Phase 0: Audited product-card.tsx, checkout-dialog.tsx, page.tsx, types/grocery.ts, mock-data.ts. Confirmed Product type already has organic/onSale/tags fields. Planned backward-compatible extensions.
- Phase 1: Product detail modal. Extended Product type with optional fields (rating, reviewCount, longDescription, benefits, storageTip, origin). Added enrichment layer in mock-data.ts (derive rating 4.2-4.9 + reviewCount 24-480 deterministically from itemCode hash; derive benefits/storageTip/origin from category & tags). Exported MOCK_PRODUCTS_ENRICHED (kept raw MOCK_PRODUCTS for backward compat). Updated erpnext.ts to return enriched products in mock fallback. Created ProductDetailDialog component: split-pane layout (visual + info), rating stars, price with discount, tags, long description, benefits list, info grid (asal/kategori/penyimpanan), trust badges, qty stepper, add-to-cart with toast. Wrapper uses keyed inner component to auto-reset qty on product change (no useEffect needed — clean React pattern). Updated ProductCard with optional onOpenDetail prop (backward compatible): card body & image clickable, action buttons stop propagation, card shows compact rating. Updated ProductGrid to forward onOpenDetail. Wired in page.tsx. Committed.
- Phase 2: Advanced filter. Created AdvancedFilter component with Popover trigger. Filter state: priceRange [min,max], organicOnly, onSaleOnly, tags[]. Price range uses shadcn Slider (dual thumb) with bounds derived from product list. Toggle chips for organic & on-sale (aria-pressed). Tag chips with AND logic. Active filter count badge on trigger. Reset button. Exported pure applyFilter() function. DEFAULT_FILTER constant. Wired in page.tsx: filter state + applyFilter in filteredProducts memo. Verified: organic filter 23->4, tag 'impor' 23->2, price max 101000 23->21, reset back to 23. Committed.
- Phase 3: Testimonials section. Created TestimonialsSection with id='testimoni' anchor. 4 platform stats (4.9/5 rating, 98% puas, 120+ petani, 15K+ pesanan/bulan). 6 testimonials with diverse personas from various cities. Each: emoji avatar, star rating (4.5-5), quote, name+role+location, 'Verified' badge. Trust strip at bottom with CTA to #belanja. Framer Motion scroll-reveal. Placed between About and FAQ. Committed.
- Phase 4: Trust badges. Created reusable TrustBadges component with 2 variants (compact: 4 icon badges + payment chips; grid: 2x2 with title+desc). 4 trust signals: Pembayaran Aman (SSL), Garansi Segar (refund 100%), Refund Mudah (24h), Antar Cepat (2 jam). 6 payment methods: COD, BCA, Mandiri, GoPay, OVO, DANA. Integrated into CheckoutDialog (compact, below submit button) and CartSheet (mini trust strip below Checkout button). Committed.
- Phase 5: Full verification. API test via curl: all 4 routes return 200/201 with correct data, contact validation returns 422 with 4 errors. Browser test via Agent Browser: all 6 sections render, advanced filter works (23->4 organic, 23->2 impor, 23->21 price max), product detail modal opens with full content, add to cart from modal works, checkout form fill + submit + success state, trust badges (4) confirmed in checkout, mobile responsive (390x844), dark mode toggle works. Zero console errors/warnings. Committed.

Stage Summary:
- 6 commits total (1 per phase + 1 chore for accidental screenshot removal + 1 docs).
- Sprint 2 scope complete: product detail modal, advanced filter, testimonials section, trust badges in checkout.
- Backward compatibility maintained: ProductCard props unchanged (onOpenDetail optional), ProductGrid props unchanged (onOpenDetail optional), AdvancedFilter optional, applyFilter pure function, Product type only added optional fields, ProductDetailDialog wrapper handles null product gracefully.
- Code quality: ESLint clean (used keyed component pattern instead of useEffect for qty reset), zero console errors, zero console warnings.
- New components: product-detail-dialog, advanced-filter, testimonials-section, trust-badges.
- New exports: MOCK_PRODUCTS_ENRICHED, DEFAULT_FILTER, applyFilter, FilterState type.
- API unchanged (no new routes needed — enrichment happens in mock-data layer).
- Accessibility: aria-label on clickable cards, aria-pressed on toggle chips, aria-label on sliders, sr-only DialogDescription, semantic headings.
- Verified via Agent Browser (desktop 1440x900 + mobile 390x844): all interactions work end-to-end including golden path (add cart -> checkout -> success) with all Sprint 2 features active.

Task ID: sprint3-phase1-to-5
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Sprint 3 - Back-to-top, dismissible promo banner, checkout step indicator, ETA

Work Log:
- Phase 0: Audited page.tsx (promo banner inline, no back-to-top), checkout-dialog.tsx (3 steps but no visual indicator, no ETA), cart-sheet.tsx (no ETA), footer.tsx (has static ArrowUp but not floating). Planned 4 backward-compatible features.
- Phase 1: Back-to-top button. Created BackToTop component: floating fixed position bottom-right, appears after scroll >500px, smooth scroll on click. requestAnimationFrame + ticking flag for scroll perf (passive listener). Framer Motion enter/exit animations. h-11 w-11 (≥44px touch target). aria-label, focus-visible ring. Configurable props (threshold, bottom, right). Mounted in page.tsx floating UI section. Verified: hidden at top, visible after scroll, click → smooth scroll to top + auto-hide. Mobile 390x844 works. Committed.
- Phase 2: Dismissible promo banner. Created PromoBanner component: extract inline banner to reusable. Dismiss X button (top-right, aria-label='Tutup promo'). Persist dismiss in localStorage (key: promo-dismissed-{promoId}). Cross-tab sync via storage event listener. Framer Motion height+opacity animation on enter/exit. Lazy useState initializer reads localStorage (no useEffect setState — passes lint). Configurable: promoId (change to reset campaign), title, description, icon. Replace inline banner in page.tsx with <PromoBanner />. Verified: visible by default, dismiss hides, reload stays hidden (localStorage='1'). Committed.
- Phase 3: Checkout step indicator. Created CheckoutSteps component: 3 steps (Data Pengiriman, Memproses, Selesai). Visual states: current (primary fill + ring), completed (checkmark), future (muted). Animated connector lines (Framer Motion width transition). In loading state: step 2 shows Loader2 spinner. In success state: all 3 steps show checkmarks, all connectors 100% filled. aria-current='step' on active step. Pure presentational driven by 'current' prop. Integrated into CheckoutDialog above conditional rendering. Verified: step 1 active in form, all 3 checkmarks in success. Committed.
- Phase 4: Estimated delivery time. Created lib/delivery.ts with estimateDelivery() pure function: business hours 08-21 WIB (skip Sunday), same-day cutoff 19:00, delivery 2-hour window, pickup 30-min ready. Returns methodLabel, earliestDate, dateLabel (Hari ini/Besok/Senin 12 Mei), timeWindow (15:00-17:00 WIB), durationHours, sameDay, icon. Created DeliveryEstimateDisplay component: 2 variants (compact pill, card with icon). Integrated into CartSheet (card in footer summary), CheckoutDialog (card below delivery RadioGroup, real-time updates on method switch), SuccessView (shows ETA for confirmed method). Verified: cart ETA 'Estimasi Antar SAME DAY 11:00-13:00 WIB', pickup ETA '10:28-10:58 WIB', real-time switch works. Committed.
- Phase 5: Full verification. API regression: all 4 routes return 200/201 with correct data. Browser golden path: promo banner visible/dismissible/persists, back-to-top appears on scroll, cart shows ETA, checkout step indicator (step 1 active, 3 checkmarks in success), checkout ETA updates on method switch, success view shows ETA, zero console errors. Mobile 390x844 verified. Committed.

Stage Summary:
- 6 commits total (1 per phase + 1 docs).
- Sprint 3 scope complete: back-to-top, dismissible promo banner, checkout step indicator, specific estimated delivery time.
- Backward compatibility maintained: BackToTop optional (no existing components changed), PromoBanner replaces inline with same default content, CheckoutSteps added above existing content (no logic changes), DeliveryEstimateDisplay optional (no existing props changed), estimateDelivery pure function, no API contract changes.
- Code quality: ESLint clean (used lazy useState initializer for localStorage read — no useEffect setState needed), zero console errors, zero console warnings.
- New components: back-to-top, promo-banner, checkout-steps, delivery-estimate.
- New utility: lib/delivery.ts (estimateDelivery pure function, DeliveryEstimate interface).
- Accessibility: aria-label on back-to-top & dismiss button, aria-current='step' on active step, aria-label on step list, focus-visible ring on interactive elements.
- Verified via Agent Browser (desktop 1440x900 + mobile 390x844): all 4 Sprint 3 features work end-to-end in golden path.

Task ID: sprint4-phase1-to-5
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Sprint 4 - Wishlist, recently viewed, newsletter signup, cookie consent

Work Log:
- Phase 0: Audited product-card.tsx (image button, hover hint), cart.ts (zustand persist pattern), footer.tsx (4-col grid), prisma/schema.prisma (ContactMessage model). Planned 4 backward-compatible features.
- Phase 1: Wishlist. Created lib/store/wishlist.ts (zustand + persist, cap 50 items). Created WishlistButton component (2 variants: overlay for cards, inline for detail; 3 sizes; spring animation; stopPropagation). Created WishlistSheet component (drawer with items list, move to cart, remove, clear). Integrated heart button into ProductCard (replaced Eye hover hint). Fixed nested-button bug: changed image area from <button> to <div role='button'> so heart <button> inside is valid HTML. Added heart icon + count badge in Header. Added wishlist quick action in MobileNav. Mounted WishlistSheet in page.tsx. Verified: 23 hearts render, click adds to wishlist, header count updates, drawer shows items, move to cart works. Committed.
- Phase 2: Recently viewed. Created lib/store/recently-viewed.ts (zustand + persist, cap 8 items, most recent first). Created useRecentlyViewed hook (wrapper around store). Created RecentlyViewedSection component (horizontal scroll mobile, 6-col grid desktop, clear button). Wired addRecentlyViewed in handleOpenDetail. Bug fix: initially used excludeIds prop to filter products in main grid — but ALL products are in grid by default, so recently viewed was always empty. Removed excludeIds. Bug fix: initially used local useState hook — 2 instances (page + section) had separate state. Converted to zustand store for single source of truth. Verified: section hidden initially, appears after opening details, most recent first, persists across reload, click reopens detail, clear works. Committed.
- Phase 3: Newsletter signup. Added NewsletterSubscriber model to Prisma (email unique, status, source, timestamps). Pushed schema + regenerated client. Created /api/newsletter POST route (zod validation, idempotent — re-subscribe returns 'already subscribed', reactivate unsubscribed users) + DELETE route (unsubscribe by email). Created NewsletterForm component (email input + Langganan button, idle→loading→success states, aria-invalid + role=alert, toast). Integrated into Footer as newsletter strip above main grid (2-col: heading + form). Bug fix: Prisma Client not regenerated after schema push — had to run bun run db:generate + restart dev server. Verified via curl: new/duplicate/invalid/unsubscribe/reactivate all work. Verified via Agent Browser: form renders, valid submit → success, invalid → error. Committed.
- Phase 4: Cookie consent. Created CookieConsent component: fixed bottom banner with Cookie icon, text, Accept/Decline buttons. Persists in localStorage (cookie-consent-v1). Framer Motion slide-up animation. Mounted in root layout. SSR-safe: starts hidden, reads localStorage via useEffect after mount (standard SSR pattern, block eslint-disable for set-state-in-effect). Bug fix: initially used lazy useState init — but SSR returns null and hydration doesn't re-read localStorage, so banner reappeared on reload. Fixed by using useEffect to sync state after mount. Verified: first visit shows banner, accept/decline hides + persists, reload stays hidden. Committed.
- Phase 5: Full verification. API test: all 5 routes return 200/201 with correct data. Browser golden path: cookie banner appears → accept, 23 wishlist hearts → click 2 → header count=2, open detail → recently viewed section appears, newsletter form in footer → subscribe → success. Zero console errors. Committed.

Stage Summary:
- 7 commits total (1 per phase + 1 chore for upload dir cleanup + 1 docs).
- Sprint 4 scope complete: wishlist, recently viewed, newsletter signup, cookie consent.
- Backward compatibility maintained: wishlist purely additive (no existing props changed), recently viewed purely additive, newsletter only added new Prisma model + API route, cookie consent mounted in layout (no existing changed).
- Code quality: ESLint clean (used block eslint-disable for cookie consent useEffect — legitimate SSR localStorage sync pattern), zero console errors, zero console warnings.
- New components: wishlist-button, wishlist-sheet, recently-viewed-section, newsletter-form, cookie-consent.
- New stores: lib/store/wishlist.ts, lib/store/recently-viewed.ts.
- New API: /api/newsletter (POST subscribe + DELETE unsubscribe).
- New Prisma model: NewsletterSubscriber (email unique, status, source).
- New hook: use-recently-viewed.ts (wrapper around zustand store).
- Accessibility: aria-label on heart buttons, aria-pressed state, role=dialog on cookie banner, aria-live=polite, role=alert on newsletter errors.
- Verified via Agent Browser (desktop 1440x900): all 4 Sprint 4 features work end-to-end in golden path.

Task ID: sprint5-phase0-to-9
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Sprint 5 - Admin dashboard for content management (owner + non-technical staff)

Work Log:
- Phase 0: Added 4 Prisma models (SiteSetting singleton with 30+ optional fields, FAQ, Testimonial, CategorySetting). Pushed schema + regenerated client. Created scripts/seed-content.ts with upsert pattern (idempotent) — seeded SiteSetting + 8 FAQs + 6 testimonials + 4 categories with existing hardcoded values. Added 'db:seed' script. Committed.
- Phase 1: Added ADMIN_PASSWORD env var. Created lib/admin-auth.ts (verifyAdmin reads Bearer token, constant-time compare). Created lib/content.ts (DB fetchers with null fallback). Created 8 API routes: /api/admin/login (POST), /api/admin/content (GET+POST with auth), /api/admin/faqs (GET+POST) + [id] (PUT+DELETE), /api/admin/testimonials (GET+POST) + [id] (PUT+DELETE), /api/admin/categories (GET+POST) + [id] (PUT+DELETE). Bug fix: Next.js 16 dynamic route params are async Promise — applied `await params` to all [id] routes. Verified via curl: login, auth gate, CRUD all work. Committed.
- Phase 2-7: Created lib/admin-client.ts (sessionStorage token, loginAdmin, adminFetch wrapper). Created components/admin/admin-ui.tsx (reusable primitives: AdminSectionHeading, AdminField, SaveButton with loading/success states, DeleteButton with arm-then-confirm, AdminCard, AdminEmptyState, useAdminFetch hook). Created admin-overlay.tsx (full-screen overlay, password gate LoginGate, 8 sidebar tabs, top bar with Preview/Logout/Close, keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+A). Created 6 editor sections: hero-promo-contact-editor (shared SiteSetting form), faq-editor (CRUD + reorder + publish toggle), testimonial-editor (CRUD + emoji/star picker), about-editor (story + 4 stats + 4 values), category-editor (CRUD + emoji/gradient picker), footer-editor (brand text + tagline). Bug fix: lucide-react doesn't export 'Footer' icon, replaced with 'PanelBottom'. Committed.
- Phase 8: Created lib/page-content.ts (server-side getPageContent fetcher — reads all content in parallel with fallback). Restructured routing: page.tsx → server component fetches content → renders HomeClient (client component) with content prop. Migrated 7 section components to accept optional content props with fallback to hardcoded defaults (Hero, PromoBanner, AboutSection, TestimonialsSection, FaqSection, ContactSection, Footer). Added admin button (Settings icon) in footer. Verified end-to-end: edit Hero CTA via API → reload → frontend reflects change; edit FAQ via API → reload → frontend reflects update. Committed.
- Phase 9: Full verification. API test: all admin routes work (login auth gate, content GET/POST, FAQ CRUD, testimonial CRUD, category CRUD). Browser golden path: page loads with DB content, all 6 sections render, footer admin button works, Ctrl+Shift+A opens overlay, Escape closes, all 8 tabs render editors with DB data, zero console errors. Committed.

Stage Summary:
- 4 commits total (Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2-7 combined, Phase 8, Phase 9 docs).
- Sprint 5 scope complete: admin dashboard for 8 content types (Hero, Promo, Contact, FAQ, Testimonials, About, Categories, Footer).
- Backward compatibility maintained: all section content props optional with fallback to hardcoded defaults — site works identically if DB empty. No existing API routes changed. New admin routes purely additive.
- Code quality: ESLint clean (used lazy useState init + block eslint-disable for cookie-consent pattern), zero console errors, zero console warnings.
- New components: admin-overlay, admin-ui, 6 editor sections (hero-promo-contact, faq, testimonial, about, category, footer).
- New stores/lib: lib/admin-auth.ts, lib/admin-client.ts, lib/content.ts, lib/page-content.ts.
- New API routes: /api/admin/login, /api/admin/content, /api/admin/faqs + [id], /api/admin/testimonials + [id], /api/admin/categories + [id] (8 routes total).
- New Prisma models: SiteSetting, FAQ, Testimonial, CategorySetting.
- New script: scripts/seed-content.ts + 'db:seed' command.
- Auth: password gate (ADMIN_PASSWORD env var), sessionStorage token, Bearer auth header, constant-time compare.
- Accessibility: password gate form with aria-invalid + role=alert, sidebar tabs with aria-current, dialog role + aria-modal + aria-label.
- Non-technical staff friendly: tab navigation, form fields with Indonesian labels, emoji/gradient/star pickers, SaveButton with visual feedback, DeleteButton with arm-then-confirm (prevent accidental delete), toast notifications for all actions.
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+A to open admin, Escape to close.
- Verified via Agent Browser: all 8 editors load with DB data, content changes reflect on frontend after reload.

Task ID: sprint6-phase0-to-5
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Sprint 6 - Skenario C (audit log + rate limit) + Plan B documentation

Work Log:
- Phase 0: Audited existing admin API (8 routes, verifyAdmin pattern, no rate limit, no audit). Planned audit log integration + rate limit approach.
- Phase 1: Added AdminAuditLog Prisma model (id, action, target, ip, userAgent, success, detail, createdAt with indexes). Created lib/audit.ts with logAdminAction() helper (fire-and-forget, non-blocking), getClientIp() (X-Forwarded-For aware), getAuditLogs() with filtering. Integrated audit logging into all 8 admin API routes: login (login_success/failed/rate_limited), content POST (update with field names), faqs/testimonials/categories CRUD (create/update/delete/publish_toggle/reorder). All unauthorized attempts logged. Added /api/admin/audit GET route (requires auth, filterable). Verified via curl: 7 audit entries logged correctly with action/target/ip/timestamp.
- Phase 2: Created lib/rate-limit.ts: in-memory sliding window per IP. Two-tier: soft limit (5 attempts per 15 min → block 15 min), hard limit (20 attempts per 24h → block 24h). Cleanup old entries every 10 min. Applied to /api/admin/login: returns 429 with Retry-After header. Verified via curl: 5 wrong attempts → 401, 6th → 429, correct password after block → 429 (still blocked).
- Phase 3: Created AuditLogViewer component: lists admin actions with filtering (action type, success status, search), stats summary (total/success/failed), color-coded badges per action type, relative time with full time tooltip, IP address display. Bug fix: initially used useAdminFetch hook which extracted first non-success key (entries array only) but component expected full { entries, total } object → client crash. Fixed by using custom fetch with useState. Added 'Audit Log' tab to admin overlay sidebar (ScrollText icon, 9 tabs total). Verified: tab renders, 15 log entries, stats show total=15, zero errors.
- Phase 4: Created docs/PLAN_B_NEXTAUTH_MIGRATION.md: comprehensive migration plan from Skenario C to NextAuth.js. Documents: 6 trigger conditions, 8-day migration plan (2 sprints), dependencies, email service options, what stays same from Skenario C (~60% reusable), risks & mitigations, cost comparison, decision framework. Key insight: audit log + rate limit from Skenario C are reusable in NextAuth (just add userId column).
- Phase 5: Full verification. API test: login (correct/wrong/rate-limited), content update (triggers audit), FAQ create (triggers audit), audit log entries verified with correct action/target/success. Browser golden path: page loads, admin opens, login works, 9 tabs render, Audit Log tab shows 15 entries with stats, zero console errors. Committed.

Stage Summary:
- 4 commits total (Phase 1+2 combined, Phase 3, Phase 4, Phase 5 docs).
- Sprint 6 scope complete: Skenario C (audit log + rate limit) + Plan B documentation.
- Backward compatible: audit logging is additive (no existing API contract changed), rate limit only adds 429 for abuse, audit viewer is new tab (no existing editors changed).
- Code quality: ESLint clean, zero console errors, zero console warnings.
- New components: audit-log-viewer.
- New lib: lib/audit.ts (logAdminAction, getClientIp, getUserAgent, getAuditLogs), lib/rate-limit.ts (checkRateLimit, resetRateLimit).
- New API: /api/admin/audit GET (list logs with filtering).
- New Prisma model: AdminAuditLog (id, action, target, ip, userAgent, success, detail, createdAt).
- New docs: docs/PLAN_B_NEXTAUTH_MIGRATION.md (NextAuth migration plan with trigger conditions).
- Security improvements: brute force protection (5/15min, 20/24h), audit trail (IP + timestamp + action), unauthorized attempt logging.
- Plan B readiness: ~60% of NextAuth work already done by Skenario C (audit log + rate limit reusable, just add userId column). Migration can be triggered when: karyawan > 15, turnover, compliance, public access, roles needed, multi-tenant.

Task ID: sprint7-phase0-to-5
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Sprint 7 - Order Tracking (customer tracking + admin management)

Work Log:
- Phase 0: Audited existing checkout flow (creates Sales Order in ERPNext/mock, no Order record in Prisma, no tracking UI). Planned Order model + tracking ID + customer tracking + admin management.
- Phase 1: Added Order Prisma model (id, trackingId unique 6-char, customer info snapshot, itemsJson, pricing, delivery+payment method, status workflow, erpSalesOrderName link, estimatedDelivery, statusHistoryJson). Created lib/orders.ts with generateTrackingId() (SB prefix + 4 chars, collision-safe), createOrder(), getOrderByTrackingId(), getOrderById(), listOrders(), updateOrderStatus() with history append. Migrated /api/checkout POST to also create Order record + return trackingId + estimatedDelivery. Updated CheckoutResponse type with trackingId + estimatedDelivery fields. Verified: checkout returns trackingId='SBKS26'.
- Phase 2: Created 3 API routes: /api/orders/[trackingId] GET (public customer track, 404 if not found), /api/admin/orders GET (list with filter+search, requires auth), /api/admin/orders/[id] GET+PUT (get single + update status with validation + audit log). Verified via curl: customer track returns order with items+history, invalid tracking→404, admin list returns orders, admin update status appends to history.
- Phase 3: Created OrderTrackingDialog component (customer UI): input tracking ID → fetch /api/orders/[trackingId] → display order with tracking ID (copyable), status badge, progress timeline (5 steps with checkmarks/spinner/cancelled), customer info, order items, pricing summary, estimated delivery. Pre-fill from checkout success. Update CheckoutDialog SuccessView: show tracking ID prominently (primary card, copyable), add 'Lacak Pesanan' button. Update Footer: add '📦 Lacak Pesanan' link in Bantuan section. Wire in home-client: trackingOpen state, handleTrackOrder. Verified: footer link opens dialog, valid tracking shows order details, invalid shows error.
- Phase 4: Created OrderEditor component (admin UI): stats summary (total/pending/preparing/out_for_delivery), filter by status, search by tracking/name/phone, order list with tracking ID + status badge + customer + items + total + date + quick status dropdown, expandable details (customer info, order items, pricing, payment, ERP link, status history timeline). Add 'Pesanan' tab to admin sidebar (Package icon, FIRST tab). Default tab changed to 'orders'. Verified: default tab 'Pesanan', 3 orders listed, expand shows customer+details+history, zero errors.
- Phase 5: Full golden path test. API: checkout creates order with tracking ID → customer track → admin list → admin update status (pending→confirmed→preparing, history grows) → customer re-track sees updated status. Existing APIs (products, categories, content) still work. Browser: page loads, footer 'Lacak Pesanan' link, admin default tab 'Pesanan' with 3 orders, zero console errors. Committed.

Stage Summary:
- 5 commits total (Phase 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
- Sprint 7 scope complete: order tracking (customer) + order management (admin).
- Backward compatible: Order model additive, checkout still creates ERPNext Sales Order (now also creates Prisma Order), all new API routes, tracking UI is new dialog, admin tab is new. No existing API/UI changed.
- Code quality: ESLint clean, zero console errors, zero console warnings.
- New components: order-tracking-dialog (customer), order-editor (admin).
- New lib: lib/orders.ts (createOrder, getOrderByTrackingId, getOrderById, listOrders, updateOrderStatus, generateTrackingId, OrderStatus types + labels + colors + icons).
- New API routes: /api/orders/[trackingId] GET, /api/admin/orders GET, /api/admin/orders/[id] GET+PUT.
- New Prisma model: Order (id, trackingId, customer info, itemsJson, pricing, status workflow, erpSalesOrderName, estimatedDelivery, statusHistoryJson).
- Customer flow: checkout → get tracking ID → track via footer link → see status timeline + history.
- Admin flow: open admin → default 'Pesanan' tab → list orders → filter/search → expand details → update status via dropdown → audit logged.
- Status workflow: pending → confirmed → preparing → out_for_delivery → delivered (or cancelled). 6 statuses with labels, colors, icons.
- Verified via curl (full golden path) + Agent Browser (UI end-to-end).

Task ID: sprint8
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Sprint 8 - Product Photos (AI-generated images + ProductImage component)

Work Log:
- Generated 6 AI product photos using z-ai image-generation CLI (tomat, apel, brokoli, bayam, wortel, anggur). 1024x1024 professional product photography style.
- Added PRODUCT_IMAGES mapping in mock-data.ts enrichment layer (product ID → image path).
- Created ProductImage component: reusable image renderer with emoji fallback on error. Supports emojiClassName, animateOnHover, className, lazy loading.
- Updated 5 components: ProductCard, ProductDetailDialog, CartSheet, WishlistSheet, RecentlyViewedSection. All now show product photos when available, emoji fallback otherwise.
- Inline emoji in order lists (checkout, tracking, admin) kept as-is (too small for thumbnails).
- Verified: 6 images render on cards, detail dialog shows photo, cart shows thumbnail, zero errors.

Stage Summary:
- 1 commit. Sprint 8 complete.
- Backward compatible: 17 of 23 products still use emoji (no image). ProductImage falls back gracefully.
- New component: product-image.tsx.
- New assets: 6 AI-generated PNGs in public/products/.

Task ID: sprint9
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Sprint 9 - Mock payment gateway (VA + e-wallet + COD)

Work Log:
- Added Payment Prisma model (orderId, trackingId, method, amount, status, vaNumber, vaBank, paymentUrl, paidAt).
- Created lib/payments.ts: createPayment() (mock VA for transfer, mock URL for e-wallet, skip for COD), simulatePayment() (marks paid + updates order to confirmed).
- Created /api/payments/create + /api/payments/[paymentId]/confirm API routes.
- Updated /api/checkout to also create payment record + return payment details.
- Updated CheckoutDialog SuccessView: payment instructions per method (VA number for transfer, payment link for e-wallet, COD message), "Saya Sudah Bayar" button → confirm → order status confirmed.
- Verified: transfer creates VA, confirm marks paid, COD skips payment. Zero errors.
- Ready for Midtrans upgrade: replace mock VA/URL generation with real Midtrans API.

Stage Summary:
- 1 commit. Sprint 9 complete.
- Backward compatible: payment fields optional, COD flow unchanged.
- New: lib/payments.ts, 2 API routes, Payment model, SuccessView payment UI.

Task ID: sprint10
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Sprint 10 - Order History Lookup (customer 'login' alternative)

Work Log:
- Created /api/orders/history GET: search by email or phone, returns all matching orders (no registration needed).
- Created OrderHistoryDialog: input email/phone → list orders with tracking ID, status, total, date → 'Lacak' button opens tracking.
- Added '📋 Riwayat Pesanan' link in footer.
- Verified: email search finds 1 order, phone search finds 6, 'Lacak' button opens tracking dialog.
- Practical alternative to NextAuth: no registration, uses existing order data, works for repeat customers.

Stage Summary:
- 1 commit. Sprint 10 complete.
- Backward compatible: new dialog + API only.
- New: /api/orders/history, order-history-dialog component.

Task ID: sprint11-branding
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Branding Lite — brand name + social links + meta description (admin editable)

Work Log:
- Phase 0: Audited all "SayurBox" references (25+ locations) + social media placeholder links.
- Phase 1: Added 7 brand fields to SiteSetting Prisma model (brandName, metaDescription, socialInstagram, socialFacebook, socialTwitter, socialTiktok, socialWhatsapp). Updated seed script. Updated content API whitelist. Updated page-content.ts type + NULL_CONTENT.
- Phase 2: Created BrandSettingsEditor component (brand name + meta description + 5 social URL fields). Added "Branding" tab to admin overlay (Palette icon, 11 tabs total).
- Phase 3: Migrated Header (brandName prop → logo text + aria-label). Footer (brandName → logo text + copyright). layout.tsx (generateMetadata → dynamic title/description from DB). All with "SayurBox" fallback.
- Phase 4: Social links in footer now filter by URL availability. Only shows icons that have URLs configured. Links open in new tab with rel=noopener. No more disabled placeholders.
- Phase 5: Verified end-to-end: API update brandName → page title/header/footer/copyright all reflect new name. Social link active when URL provided. Admin Branding tab shows current values. Zero errors. Reset works.

Stage Summary:
- 1 commit. Sprint 11 complete.
- Backward compatible: all brand fields optional with "SayurBox" fallback. Social links hidden when null. No existing behavior changed.
- New: BrandSettingsEditor, 7 Prisma fields, generateMetadata, Header brandName prop, Footer social link activation.
- Owner can now rebrand (name + social links + SEO) without developer — all via admin dashboard.

Task ID: restore-admin-1
Agent: general-purpose sub-agent
Task: Restore missing admin files (admin-overlay reverted + 3 missing section components)

Work Log:
- Audited current state: admin-overlay.tsx had been reverted to an old version (password-only LoginGate, no SessionProvider/useSession usage, no ProductEditor/UserEditor/HeaderEditor imports, no user display in header, used `loginAdmin()` + `clearAdminToken()` instead of NextAuth-aware helpers, "SayurBox Admin" brand). admin-client.ts was missing `loginAdminNextAuth`, `loginAdminLegacy`, `logoutAdmin`, `checkAuthStatus`, `AdminUser` type, and current-user-id helpers. The three section components (product-editor.tsx, user-editor.tsx, header-editor.tsx) did not exist.
- Updated src/lib/admin-client.ts: added `AdminRole` + `AdminUser` types, `setCurrentUserId` / `getCurrentUserId` helpers (sessionStorage "admin-user-id"), `loginAdminNextAuth(email, password)` (POSTs to /api/admin/login with email+password, stores token + user id), `loginAdminLegacy(password)` (alias with empty email for backward-compat password gate), `logoutAdmin()` (best-effort POST /api/admin/logout + clears token + user id), `checkAuthStatus()` (GET /api/admin/auth/me, returns AdminUser | null). Kept `loginAdmin` as a thin alias for any external callers.
- Rewrote src/components/admin/admin-overlay.tsx: outer `AdminOverlay` wraps everything in `SessionProvider` from next-auth/react; inner `AdminOverlayInner` holds state. Added 3 new tabs ("products" → ProductEditor, "header" → HeaderEditor, "users" → UserEditor — users adminOnly, filtered out for non-admin roles). On mount, calls `checkAuthStatus()` to populate user + keep authed=true (falls back to legacy authed=true if endpoint missing). Header now shows current user (avatar initials, name, RoleBadge). LoginGate has email (optional) + password fields — empty email → legacy gate, filled email → NextAuth. Logout uses `logoutAdmin()`. Brand changed from "SayurBox Admin" → "SayurLogi Admin" (both in header and LoginGate subtitle).
- Created src/components/admin/sections/product-editor.tsx (~700 lines): WooCommerce-style product list with search, category filter, published filter, checkbox selection + bulk publish/unpublish/delete. Inline create/edit form with all fields (itemCode, name, description, longDescription WYSIWYG textarea, category, price, oldPrice, unit, stock, emoji + emoji picker, image upload via /api/admin/products/upload with preview, organic/onSale/published toggles, tags, benefits, storageTip, origin, order, variants inline add/edit/remove). Expandable per-row detail panel. ERPNext sync button (POST /api/admin/products/sync) + sync status card (last sync, source, synced/total counts). Duplicate button. Uses adminFetch, sonner toast, framer-motion, lucide icons, admin-ui primitives.
- Created src/components/admin/sections/user-editor.tsx (~400 lines): user list with avatar (initials), name, email, RoleBadge (super_admin/admin/staff with ShieldCheck/ShieldUser/User icons), active status, last login timestamp. Stats summary (total/active/nonactive/admin count). Search by email/name/role. Create modal (email + name + password + role select + active toggle). Edit modal (email readonly, name + optional password + role + active; self-aware — cannot toggle own active). Delete confirmation modal at z-[200] (above AdminOverlay's z-[100]) with destructive styling. Quick toggle-active button per row. Self-protection: current user id read from sessionStorage "admin-user-id"; disable/delete buttons hidden on own row; "Anda" badge marks self.
- Created src/components/admin/sections/header-editor.tsx (~150 lines): preview card showing current top bar (shipping promo left, phone + badge right) with skeleton loading state. Edit card with 3 AdminField inputs: topBarShipping, contactPhone, topBarBadge (each with appropriate Lucide icon prefix). SaveButton posts to /api/admin/content. Hint that changes appear after reload.
- Verified: `bun run lint` passes with 0 errors (exit 0). `bunx tsc --noEmit` shows no errors in any of the touched files (admin-overlay.tsx, admin-client.ts, product-editor.tsx, user-editor.tsx, header-editor.tsx). Remaining pre-existing tsc errors in unrelated files (faq-section.tsx, erpnext.ts, payments.ts) are out of scope.

Stage Summary:
- 1 file updated: src/lib/admin-client.ts (added NextAuth-aware helpers + AdminUser type + user-id storage).
- 1 file rewritten: src/components/admin/admin-overlay.tsx (SessionProvider pattern, email+password LoginGate, 3 new tabs, user display, SayurLogi brand, logoutAdmin).
- 3 files created: src/components/admin/sections/product-editor.tsx, user-editor.tsx, header-editor.tsx.
- Backward compatible: legacy `loginAdmin()` still works (alias to `loginAdminLegacy`). Existing tabs unchanged. NextAuth credentials provider endpoint /api/admin/login still receives `{ password }` (legacy) or `{ email, password }` (NextAuth) — both work. The new admin API routes (products, users, auth/me, products/sync, products/upload, products/bulk) are referenced but not implemented in this task — they will 404 gracefully and the components show empty/error states.
- Brand migration: "SayurBox Admin" → "SayurLogi Admin" in admin-overlay (header + LoginGate subtitle). Other SayurBox references (header logo text, footer copyright, layout metadata) still use brandName from DB — those are admin-editable via Branding tab and out of scope for this restore.
- Code quality: ESLint clean (0 errors), TypeScript clean for all touched files. All section components use "use client", Lucide icons only (no Phosphor — avoids SSR errors), sonner toast, framer-motion, adminFetch, admin-ui primitives (AdminSectionHeading/AdminField/SaveButton/AdminCard/AdminEmptyState/DeleteButton). All UI text in Indonesian.
- Self-protection: UserEditor reads currentUserId from sessionStorage on mount; hides disable/delete/active-toggle on own row; marks own row with "Anda" badge; shows warning in edit modal when editing self. AdminOverlay stores user id to sessionStorage on login + on checkAuthStatus success.

Task ID: restore-all-1
Agent: general-purpose sub-agent
Task: Restore all missing schema + API + features (sprints 12-24 fields, Product/ProductVariant models, products/users CRUD APIs, lib helpers, seed scripts)

Work Log:
- Audited current state: prisma/schema.prisma was at Sprint 11 state (only brand fields on SiteSetting, no Product/ProductVariant models, no discount on Order). No /api/admin/products, /api/admin/users, /api/admin/favicon, /api/admin/about, /api/admin/logout routes existed. /api/products was using ERPNext-only fetchProducts (no DB fallback). Library files products-db.ts, users-db.ts, permissions.ts, shipping.ts, reward.ts, erpnext-sync.ts were missing. No seed-admin.ts or seed-products.ts scripts. content API whitelist did not include the new sprints 12-24 fields. page-content.ts PageContent interface was missing all new fields. logAdminAction signature did not accept userId/userEmail (existing admin/login route was calling it with those params but TypeScript would have flagged it — was working only because of `as any` casts in some callers).

- Prisma schema (prisma/schema.prisma):
  * SiteSetting: added 28 new nullable fields covering sprints 12-24 — faviconUrl, freeShippingThreshold (Int?), shippingFee (Int?), rewardOrderCount (Int?), rewardDiscountPercent (Int?), aboutImage, testimonialBadge, testimonialTitleA/Highlight/B, testimonialSubtitle, testimonialStat1-4Value/Label/Subtext (12 fields), topBarShipping, topBarBadge, footerCopyrightText.
  * Order: added `discount Int @default(0)` between `total` and `deliveryMethod`.
  * Product: new model with id, itemCode (@unique), name, description (@default("")), longDescription?, category, price, oldPrice?, unit, stock, emoji, image?, organic, onSale, tags? (JSON string), benefits? (JSON string), storageTip?, origin?, published, order, erpSyncedAt?, createdAt, updatedAt. Indexes on category/published/order. Variants relation.
  * ProductVariant: new model with id, productId, name, price, oldPrice?, stock, unit, sku?, createdAt, updatedAt. Cascade delete on parent Product. Index on productId.
  * Ran `bun run db:push` — schema synced, Prisma Client regenerated. No data loss (all new fields are nullable or have defaults; new tables created empty).

- Updated src/lib/audit.ts: added `logout` to AuditAction union; added `userId?` and `userEmail?` fields to LogOptions; logAdminAction now persists them to AdminAuditLog table (columns already existed from previous NextAuth migration). This unblocks the existing /api/admin/login route which was already passing userId/userEmail to logAdminAction but TypeScript was rejecting it.

- Created src/lib/products-db.ts (~290 lines): serializeProduct (Prisma row → GroceryProduct shape, parses JSON-encoded tags/benefits arrays), getPublishedProducts (DB-first with mock fallback when table empty), getAllProducts, getProductById, createProduct, updateProduct (merges patch onto existing), deleteProduct, bulkUpdateProducts (publish/unpublish/deleteMany), variant CRUD (addVariant, updateVariant, deleteVariant with cross-product guard). Uses structural ProductRowLike type so it accepts any Prisma include shape.

- Created src/lib/users-db.ts (~170 lines): AdminRole type, isValidRole, isValidPassword, normalizeEmail helpers. listUsers, getUserById (omit passwordHash), createUser (bcrypt 10 rounds, role validation, email normalization), updateUser (optional password change), deleteUser, getUserStats (total/active/nonActive/adminCount counts via Promise.all).

- Created src/lib/permissions.ts (~110 lines): Permission union (16 actions across content/products/orders/users/audit/categories/faqs/testimonials/favicon/about), PERMISSIONS map (role → action allowed), hasPermission, requirePermission (returns AuthResult | 403 NextResponse), requireAdmin (any-role auth check), isAuthResult type guard.

- Created src/lib/shipping.ts (~75 lines): DEFAULT_FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD=100000, DEFAULT_SHIPPING_FEE=9000 constants. getShippingConfig (reads SiteSetting, falls back to defaults). calculateShipping (subtotal → shipping/freeShipping/remainingForFreeShipping calculation).

- Created src/lib/reward.ts (~115 lines): DEFAULT_REWARD_ORDER_COUNT=5, DEFAULT_REWARD_DISCOUNT_PERCENT=10. getRewardConfig (reads SiteSetting, falls back to defaults). countCustomerOrders (counts past orders by email OR phone, excludes cancelled). calculateReward (returns pastOrders/currentOrderNumber/applies/discountPercent/discountAmount closure/label).

- Created src/lib/erpnext-sync.ts (~155 lines): syncAllFromErpnext (pulls products from ERPNext via existing fetchProducts, upserts each by itemCode preserving admin-edited fields, sets erpSyncedAt). syncSingleItem (refresh one item). downloadImage (Buffer fetch helper for ERPNext-hosted photos).

- Created 14 API route files under src/app/api/admin/products/ (route.ts GET+POST, [id]/route.ts GET+PUT+DELETE, bulk/route.ts POST, upload/route.ts POST multipart, sync/route.ts GET+POST, sync/status/route.ts GET, [id]/variants/route.ts POST, [id]/variants/[variantId]/route.ts PUT+DELETE). All use requirePermission + isAuthResult pattern, pass auth.userId/userEmail to logAdminAction. Bulk route re-checks products:delete permission when action=delete. Upload routes validate MIME type + size (5MB products/about, 2MB favicon), use randomUUID for filenames, write to public/products or public/about, upsert SiteSetting for favicon/aboutImage paths. Favicon upload cleans up old favicon files with different extensions.

- Created src/app/api/admin/users/route.ts (GET list+stats, POST create with bcrypt via users-db) and [id]/route.ts (GET, PUT with self-protection — isSelf user can't toggle own isActive or change own role, DELETE with self-protection — 422 if auth.userId === id).

- Created src/app/api/admin/favicon/upload/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/about/upload/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/logout/route.ts (audit logs logout action with userId/userEmail).

- Rewrote src/app/api/products/route.ts: now reads from DB via getPublishedProducts (DB-first, falls back to mock if table empty). Returns `source: "db" | "mock"` so storefront can show source indicator. Previously was ERPNext-only.

- Updated src/app/api/admin/content/route.ts: added 25 new fields to allowedFields whitelist (faviconUrl, aboutImage, testimonialBadge + 4 stat triplets, topBarShipping, topBarBadge, footerCopyrightText). Added intFields array for freeShippingThreshold/shippingFee/rewardOrderCount/rewardDiscountPercent — these are parsed as Number (truncated to int) or null. Switched from verifyAdmin() → verifyAuth() so we have access to auth.userId/userEmail for audit logging.

- Updated src/lib/page-content.ts: added all 28 new fields to PageContent interface (string | null for strings, number | null for ints) and to NULL_CONTENT object. getPageContent spreads setting onto NULL_CONTENT as before — `as unknown as` cast handles the structural merge.

- Created scripts/seed-admin.ts (~50 lines): idempotent upsert of super_admin user. Email/password/name from ADMIN_EMAIL/ADMIN_PASSWORD/ADMIN_NAME env vars with defaults (admin@sayurlogi.id / admin123 / "Super Admin"). bcrypt 10-round hash. Re-running refreshes password/name/role but preserves lastLoginAt.

- Created scripts/seed-products.ts (~85 lines): idempotent seed of 23 products from MOCK_PRODUCTS_ENRICHED. Skips if Product table already has rows (unless --force flag). Upserts by itemCode — on conflict refreshes ERPNext-sourced fields (name/description/category/price/oldPrice/unit/stock/emoji/image/longDescription), preserves admin-edited fields (organic/onSale/tags/benefits/storageTip/origin/published/order/erpSyncedAt). Reports created vs updated counts.

- Updated package.json: added "db:seed-admin": "bun run scripts/seed-admin.ts" and "db:seed-products": "bun run scripts/seed-products.ts" scripts alongside existing db:seed (which runs seed-content.ts).

- Ran post-change verification:
  * `bun run db:push` — schema synced, Prisma Client regenerated.
  * `bun run lint` — 0 errors (ESLint clean).
  * `bunx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors in any new/touched files. Remaining pre-existing errors in unrelated files (faq-section.tsx, erpnext.ts, payments.ts, examples/websocket/*, skills/*) are out of scope as noted in previous worklog entry.
  * `bun run db:seed-admin` — created super_admin user admin@sayurlogi.id (password = ADMIN_PASSWORD env var = "sayurbox-admin-2024").
  * `bun run db:seed-products` — seeded 23 products (23 created, 0 updated). Re-ran with --force → 23 updated, 0 created (idempotent).
  * Smoke test: started dev server, hit GET /api/products → 200 with `source: "db"`, count=23, full product objects with variants array (empty). Hit POST /api/admin/login with wrong password → 401, audit log INSERT statement confirmed it includes userId + userEmail columns. Verified via direct DB inspection that AdminAuditLog rows now persist userId/userEmail when provided.

Stage Summary:
- 1 file updated: prisma/schema.prisma (SiteSetting +28 fields, Order +discount, +2 new models Product/ProductVariant).
- 1 file updated: src/lib/audit.ts (+logout action, +userId/userEmail in LogOptions + logAdminAction).
- 1 file updated: src/app/api/admin/content/route.ts (whitelist +25 fields, +intFields array, switched to verifyAuth for user attribution).
- 1 file updated: src/lib/page-content.ts (PageContent interface +28 fields, NULL_CONTENT +28 fields).
- 1 file updated: src/app/api/products/route.ts (DB-first via getPublishedProducts).
- 1 file updated: package.json (+db:seed-admin, +db:seed-products scripts).
- 6 files created: src/lib/products-db.ts, users-db.ts, permissions.ts, shipping.ts, reward.ts, erpnext-sync.ts.
- 14 API route files created under src/app/api/admin/products/, src/app/api/admin/users/, src/app/api/admin/favicon/upload/, src/app/api/admin/about/upload/, src/app/api/admin/logout/.
- 2 scripts created: scripts/seed-admin.ts, scripts/seed-products.ts.
- Backward compatible: all new SiteSetting fields are nullable (null = use hardcoded default). New Product/ProductVariant tables created empty — public /api/products falls back to mock if empty. /api/admin/products/* routes use requirePermission which respects existing roles. Existing admin tabs (orders, hero, promo, contact, faq, testimonials, about, categories, footer, branding, audit) untouched. LoginGate still accepts both legacy password-gate and NextAuth credentials.
- Code quality: ESLint clean (0 errors), TypeScript clean for all touched files. All new API routes follow the same pattern (requirePermission → isAuthResult guard → try/catch → logAdminAction with userId/userEmail). All UI text in Indonesian. All audit-logged actions include user attribution when authenticated via NextAuth.
- Self-protection preserved: UserEditor's self-protection (cannot disable/delete own account) is now enforced both client-side (UI hides buttons) and server-side (PUT/DELETE routes check auth.userId === id and reject with 422).
- Ready for next sprint: shipping config (getShippingConfig/calculateShipping) + reward program (getRewardConfig/calculateReward) libraries are in place but not yet wired into /api/checkout — that integration is a separate task.

Task ID: grocery-redesign-001
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Redesign product section to be modern minimalist + improve mobile UX score (was 50/100)

Work Log:
- Redesigned ProductCard: removed heavy border/shadow default, photo-forward, icon-only "+" add button (was "+ Tambah" text), tighter padding (px-2 py-2.5 vs p-4), smaller discount badge, leaf-icon-only organic indicator (no text), compact rating line
- Redesigned CategoryTabs: removed gradient circle emoji bg, simpler pill style (bg-primary active / bg-secondary inactive), horizontal scroll with scrollbar-none, shrink-0 pills
- Added scrollbar-none utility to globals.css
- Rewrote ProductGrid: added load-more pagination (8 initial + 8 on click), "Menampilkan X dari Y produk" counter, minimal load-more button with ChevronDown icon, React "adjust state during render" pattern for pagination reset on filter change (no setState-in-effect)
- Created PromoCarousel component: horizontal scroll of on-sale products, orange accent (Flame icon, orange price), w-40 mobile / w-44 desktop cards, hidden if <2 promos, only shows on "Semua" view (no active category/search)
- Restructured home-client product section: sticky sub-nav (top-16 mobile / top-[94px] desktop) containing CategoryTabs + AdvancedFilter + Select sort, blurred bg backdrop, separated section heading below sticky bar, integrated PromoCarousel above main grid
- Verified sticky offsets via Agent Browser: mobile sticky at 64px (header 65px), desktop at 94px (header 94px) — correct
- Measured grid height reduction: mobile 3404px → 1031px (3.3x shorter with 8 cards vs 23)
- Lint clean, no hydration errors

Stage Summary:
- Product section mobile UX score: 50 → 78 (VLM assessed)
- Desktop product section score: 84 (VLM assessed)
- Key wins: minimalist cards (borderless, icon-only +, price-forward), sticky category+sort bar, load-more pagination, promo carousel breaks vertical monotony
- Grid height on mobile reduced 3.3x (8 cards vs 23 rendered)
- Remaining issues flagged by VLM: cookie consent obstructs grid (separate component), product name truncation on "Paket" items

---
Task ID: grocery-polish-002
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Fix 5 remaining issues — cookie banner, Paket name truncation, About section polish

Work Log:
- Cookie consent: rewrote from center modal to slim full-width bottom bar. Removed max-w-3xl card, added backdrop-blur, border-t (not border all around), shadow-[0_-4px_20px_-4px]. Mobile: single column icon+text+actions. Desktop: 3-column row. Slide-up animation from y:100%. No longer obstructs product grid.
- Product name truncation: changed line-clamp-1 → line-clamp-2 + min-h-[2.4em] in ProductCard and PromoCarousel. Paket products now show full name on 2 lines (verified: "Paket Sayur Mingguan" height=33px, "Paket Buah Keluarga" height=31px, both lineClamp=2).
- About section body text: text-foreground/70 → text-foreground/80 (darker, WCAG AA pass)
- About section micro-stats: added 3-column inline stats row below paragraph (5.000+ Pelanggan / 120+ Petani Mitra / 15 Kota), gradient text per stat (green/orange/cyan), divide-x border separators, uppercase tracking-wide labels
- About section badge: updated DB SiteSetting.aboutBadge from "Tentang Kami" → "🌱 Cerita Kami" (more distinctive). Updated code default too.
- All fixes verified via Agent Browser DOM checks + VLM scoring.

Stage Summary:
- Cookie banner: was floating card modal, now slim bottom bar (no grid obstruction)
- Paket products: was truncated "...", now full 2-line name visible
- About section score: 74 → 88 (VLM assessed)
- Overall product section mobile UX: was 78, expected +3-5 from cookie fix
- VLM comment on About: "exceptionally strong execution of modern minimalist design that rivals or exceeds Sayurbox/Segari... adopts Apple-esque/Stripe aesthetic applied to grocery vertical"
- Lint clean, no hydration errors

Task ID: grocery-depth-003
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Fix "too flat" cards in About section + hero trust badges — add depth with shadow + gradient + colored accent bars

Work Log:
- Identified root cause of "flat" cards: `border border-border/60 bg-card shadow-sm` — no elevation, pure white on white
- Redesigned About stats cards (4x): replaced border with ring-1 ring-border/50, added bg-gradient-to-br from-card via-card to-muted/50 (off-white tint), layered shadow [0_1px_3px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0_8px_24px_-12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.15)], solid colored top accent bar (h-1 bg-primary/bg-orange-500/bg-cyan-500/bg-amber-500), overflow-hidden for clean rounded corners, enhanced hover shadow
- Redesigned About values cards (4x): same treatment with per-card accent colors (green/amber/rose/cyan)
- Added `bar` property to stats/values arrays with solid color class (was using stat.color.split(" ")[0] which gave bg-X/10 = invisible at 60% opacity)
- Redesigned hero trust badges (3x): same gradient+ring+shadow+accent bar treatment, per-badge accent colors (primary/orange/amber)
- Fixed bug: accent bar was using icon's /10 opacity bg color → changed to solid `bar` property
- Verified via Agent Browser DOM: bar class = "bg-primary" (solid), background color = lab(49.58 -42.18 35.87) (solid green)
- VLM verified all cards: accent bars visible, shadow visible, off-white bg visible, cards clearly elevated

Task ID: grocery-testimonials-004
Agent: main (Z.ai Code)
Task: Fix testimonials section — card depth consistency + emoji avatar replacement

Work Log:
- Created initial-avatar helper: getInitials(name) → "DL" for "Dewi Lestari", getAvatarColor(name) → deterministic color from 6-color palette (primary/orange/amber/rose/cyan/violet) via name hash. Stable per user, no random per render.
- Applied card depth pattern to platform stat cards (4x): gradient bg + ring-1 + layered shadow + solid bg-primary top accent bar. Replaced flat border+shadow-sm style.
- Applied card depth pattern to testimonial cards (6x): same gradient+ring+shadow+accent bar treatment. Accent color is rating-aware: bg-primary for 5★, bg-amber-500 for <5★ (e.g. Budi Santoso 4.5★).
- Replaced emoji avatars (👩/👨‍🍳/👩‍💼/👨/👩‍🎨/🏃) with initial avatars — colored circle (15% opacity bg) + bold initials + ring-1 ring-inset. 6-color palette cycled deterministically by name hash.
- Testimonial text: added line-clamp-4 to prevent wall-of-text on mobile. Was unbounded.
- Verified badge: changed from generic secondary to bg-primary/10 text-primary (green-tinted) for consistency with brand.
- Quote icon + rating row restructured: Quote icon left, rating stars right (was Quote alone, then rating below). Tighter layout.
- Rating stars: h-4 → h-3.5 (smaller, more refined), rating number font-medium → font-semibold text-foreground (was muted).
- Body text: text-foreground → text-foreground/80 (consistent with About section after previous fix).

Stage Summary:
- Testimonials section score: 76 → 92 (VLM assessed)
- Card design consistency: 10/10 (perfectly unified with About section)
- Avatar professionalism: 10/10 (initials vs emoji — "massive improvement, removes cheap template feel")
- Mobile UX: 9/10 (4-line clamp excellent for scanning)
- Modern aesthetic vs Sayurbox/Segari: 9/10 ("on par or slightly ahead of market leaders, soft UI feels 2024/2025")
- VLM verdict: "This section now looks like it belongs in a funded, scalable startup application."
- Design system now fully consistent across ALL card types on the page (hero trust badges, About stats, About values, testimonial stats, testimonial cards)
- Lint clean

Work Log:

- Reorganized 8 FAQ items into categories (2 pemesanan, 2 pengiriman, 1 pembayaran, 3 produk) — sorted by category for visual grouping

Added ring-1 ring-inset ring-primary/20 around MessageCircleQuestion icon.
- Accordion trigger padding: py-5 → py-4 pl-3 (tighter, room for icon)
- Accordion trigger text: text-base → text-[15px] (slightly smaller for mobile)
- Accordion item spacing: space-y-3 → space-y-2.5 (slightly tighter)
- data-[state=open] enhanced shadow + ring-primary/30 (open item gets more elevation)
- DB fallback: DB FAQs default to "pemesanan" category (no DB schema change needed)
